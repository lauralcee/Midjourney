# Mid-Journey
What is [MidJourney](https://lifeofanailtech.com/)? MidJourney is a new AI-powered tool that can turn any imagination into artwork from text. You might have seen some messed-up AI-generated arts in the past. However, the resulting arts from MidJourney will definitely WOW you – they’re not only unique but some of them are really breathtaking. 

We’re fascinated by this text-to-image concept so we applied to be a part of this tool’s beta. We spent a few days playing with it and have so much fun! In this article, we want to show you some artworks that caught our attention. Then we will show you some keywords we have tried or we learned from others’ experiments. Hope these will give you some inspiration and help you create specific artwork with more clear and detailed instructions.
